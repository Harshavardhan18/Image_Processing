# Image_Processing

Image processing is a method to perform some operations on an image, in order to get an enhanced image or to extract some useful information from it.  It is a type of signal processing in which input is an image and output may be image or characteristics/features associated with that image.

Purpose of Image processing
The purpose of image processing is divided into 5 groups. They are:
1.      Visualization - Observe the objects that are not visible.
2.      Image sharpening and restoration - To create a better image.
3.      Image retrieval - Seek for the image of interest.
4.      Measurement of pattern – Measures various objects in an image.
5.      Image Recognition – Distinguish the objects in an image

Image Processing can be performed in various computer languages such as C++, Java, Python, Matlab etc. 

I am using C++ and opencv library which is supported by many languages, in Visual Studio to perform the following operations given bellow.

1. Color Image to Grey Scale(Black and White) Image.
2. Transpose of an Image (Colored or B&W).
3. Brightness of Image.
4. Contrast of Image (Colored or B&W).
5. Horizontal Flip of Image (Colored or B&W).
6. Vertical Flip of Image (Colored or B&W).
7. Zooming of Image
   a) Bilinear Interpolation (Colored or B&W).
   b) Nearest Neighbour Interpolation (Colored or B&W).
8. Shrinking of Image
   a) Deleting alternate rows and columns (Colored or B&W).
   b) Averageing Pixels (Colored or B&W).
9. Neighbourhood Pixels
   a) 4-connected.
   b) 8-connected.
10.Image Quantization (Colored or B&W).
11.Gamma Correction.
